2) Get as rich as possible as soon as possible, establish a productive business employing qualified people generating sustainable revenue. --'NOT DONE'--
3) Become worthy of a being a mentor, then teach. --'NOT DONE'--
4) Earn your American citizenship. Become a proud honest to god hardworking American taxpayer. --'NOT DONE'--

# General Plan: 
1) Thesis research regarding radiating FPGAs with available plasma technology. --'NOT DONE'--
2) Completing as many projects as possible for FPGA video processing. --'NOT DONE'--

2) Understanding possibilities of the experimental equipment in Vasiliev's lab with beam plasma technology for space radiation. --'NOT DONE'--
3) Starting Literature Review of fpga radiation effects, finishing first chapter of thesis. --'NOT DONE'--
4) Finishing and implementing fish eye correction on FPGA. --'NOT DONE'--
5) writing manuscript and Presentation for the YADRO conference. --'NOT DONE'--
6) Finding suitable PhD Positions. --'NOT DONE'--



# Thesis Logic: 
1) Choose Video Processing Algorithm with Space Applications and Implement it on FPGA
2) Campaign A (in-lab electron/plasma): perform stepwise irradiation with in-situ functional testing; record current, log errors, take post-IR electrical measurements after each step.
3) Campaign B (if needed, external): proton/heavy-ion or gamma irradiation to cover SEE/proton displacement/TID that electrons canâ€™t replicate.
4) Post-IR analysis: map errors to configuration memory addresses, correlate with dose, identify failure modes (SEU, SEFI, latch-up, parametric drift).
5) Deliverable: dataset + initial analysis.


# Daily Plan: 
1) Finish as manny applications as you can. 
2) Finish the presentation.
