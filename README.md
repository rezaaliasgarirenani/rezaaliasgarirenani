## Research Experience

- **[Design Center for the Development of Microprocessor Technology for AI Systems â€” System-on-Chip Development Laboratory](http://ai.mipt.ru/design-center)**
  - **Role:** Programmer / RTL Design Engineer
  - **Dates:** September 2024 â€“ Present
  - **Location:** Moscow, Russian Federation
  - **Highlights:**
    - **DSP Implementation:** Ported mathematical algorithms into efficient Verilog implementations. Built a fixed-point library and LUT-based function approximations (Hornerâ€™s method) to support fixed-point computations. Implemented image processing algorithms (rgb2hsv, color segmentation, Sobel edge detection, global tone-mapping, demosaicing, birdâ€™s-eye view, fisheye correction, image resizer) via Simulink HDL code generation and manually written Verilog. Optimized latency and throughput, resolved synchronization and pipelining issues.
    - **Simulation, Verification and Synthesis:** Created comprehensive testbenches in Verilog and used Python for simulation automation and data analysis to verify DSP functionality and performance. Synthesized, mapped, and routed HDL code using Vivado (FPGA: Xilinx Artix-7, Zybo Z7). Verified ISP algorithms by first streaming test images via HDMI from a host computer, and subsequently with a live camera connected to the FPGA.
    - **Investigation of FPGA devices under electron-beam plasma exposure:** Conducted irradiation experiments on FPGA boards using electron beams (25 â€“ 60 keV, up to 100 mA) in low-pressure oxygen atmospheres (10^{-6} â€“ 50 Torr), generating plasma and X-rays. Applied combined thermal cycling (218â€“393 K) and surface charging to evaluate FPGA reliability under radiation- and plasma-induced stress.

- **[Institute of Microelectronics Technology, Russian Academy of Sciences (IMT, RAS)](https://new.ras.ru/en/)**
  - **Role:** Laboratory Researcher
  - **Dates:** March 2023 â€“ August 2024
  - **Location:** Moscow, Russian Federation
  - **Highlights:**
    - **Experimental Equipment Installation and Automation:** Installed experimental devices including Everbeing Cryo-station (80K â€“ 450K) with 4 micromanipulators, Lakeshore Temperature Controller Model 336, Keithley SourceMeter 2450, Parametric Analyzer Keithley 4200A-SCS, Keysight Electrometer B2987A, Aktakom 3048, and Zurich Instruments MFIA Impedance Analyzer. Developed [applications](https://github.com/rezaaliasgarirenani/IMT-Automation) in MATLAB to automate experimental techniques: Thermally Stimulated Current, Capacitance-Voltage, Current-Voltage, Current-Time and Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy.
    - **Theoretical Investigation:** Developed theoretical understanding and studied experimental techniques for semiconductor devices (MOS, MOSFET, diode, RRAM). Predicted sample behavior, and determined measurement parameters.
    - **Experimental Investigation and Data Processing:** Conducted electrical characterization experiments on microelectronic structures, processed data using MATLAB and Origin Pro, removed extraneous random telegraph noise points, and compared results with theoretical models.

- **[Laboratory of Modeling of Mechanical Systems and Processes (MMSP, MIPT)](https://mipt.ru/dasr/about/kaf_faculty/mmsp)**
  - **Role:** Engineer / Technician
  - **Dates:** March 2023 â€“ August 2024
  - **Location:** Moscow, Russian Federation
  - **Highlights:**
    - **Engineering Design and Development:** Designed, developed, and analyzed models for a CubeSat orbital deployer and vibration fixture using SolidWorks. Created multiple prototypes, which passed random vibration simulation and dynamic analysis, and tested them on the UVE 4000 vibro-stand for mechanical environmental factors and vibration resistance.
