## Research Experience

### [Design Center for the Development of Microprocessor Technology for AI Systems, System-on-Chip Development Laboratory](http://ai.mipt.ru/design-center)
**Programmer / RTL Design Engineer**  
Moscow, Russian Federation  
Sep 2024 -- Present

- **DSP RTL Development:** Ported mathematical algorithms into Verilog code. Built an arithmetic fixed-point library and LUT-based function approximations using Horner's method. Implemented image signal processing algorithms using both Simulink-generated and manually written HDL code. Optimized latency and throughput by resolving synchronization and pipelining issues. **ISP** algorithms: rgb2hsv, color segmentation, Sobel edge detection, global tone-mapping, demosaic, bird's-eye view, fisheye distortion correction, and image resizing.
- **Simulation, Verification and Synthesis:** Created comprehensive testbenches in SystemVerilog and used Python for simulation automation and data analysis to verify DSP functionality and performance. Synthesized, mapped, and routed HDL code using Vivado. Verified ISP algorithms by first streaming test images via HDMI from a host computer, and subsequently with a live camera (Pcam 5C) connected to the FPGA Board (Xilinx Zybo Z7-20, Artix-7 Nexys Video).
- **Investigation of FPGA devices under electron-beam plasma exposure:** Conducted irradiation experiments on FPGA boards using electron beams (25 -- 60 keV, up to 100 mA) in low-pressure oxygen atmospheres (10^-6 -- 50 Torr), generating plasma and X-rays. Applied combined thermal cycling (218--393 K) and surface charging to evaluate FPGA reliability under radiation- and plasma-induced stress.

### [Institute of Microelectronics Technology, Russian Academy of Sciences](https://new.ras.ru/en/)
**Laboratory Researcher**  
Moscow, Russian Federation  
Mar 2023 -- Aug 2024

- **Experimental Equipment Installation and Automation:** Installed experimental devices including Everbeing Cryo-station (80K - 450K) with 4 micromanipulators, Lakeshore Temperature Controller Model 336, Keithley SourceMeter 2450, Parametric Analyzer Keithley 4200A-SCS, Keysight Electrometer B2987A, Aktakom 3048, and Zurich Instruments MFIA Impedance Analyzer. Developed [applications](https://github.com/rezaaliasgarirenani/imt_ras) in MATLAB to automate experimental techniques: Thermally Stimulated Current, Capacitance-Voltage, Current-Voltage, Current-Time and Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy.
- **Theoretical Investigation:** Developed theoretical understanding and studied experimental techniques for semiconductor devices (MOS, MOSFET, diode, RRAM). Predicted sample behavior, and determined measurement parameters.
- **Experimental Investigation and Data Processing:** Conducted electrical characterization experiments on microelectronic structures, processed data using MATLAB and Origin Pro, removed extraneous random telegraph noise points, and compared results with theoretical models.

### [Laboratory of Modeling of Mechanical Systems and Processes](https://mipt.ru/dasr/about/kaf_faculty/mmsp)
**Engineer / Technician**  
Moscow, Russian Federation  
Mar 2023 -- Aug 2024

- **Engineering Design and Development:** Designed models for a CubeSat orbital deployer and vibration fixture in SolidWorks. Prototypes passed random vibration simulation and dynamic analysis, and were tested on a UVE vibro-stand for mechanical factors.
